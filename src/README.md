## Backend (`backend/`)
The backend is built using **Node.js, Express, and MongoDB**. MongoDB is a **NoSQL database**, which allows flexible, schema-less data storage. This makes it easy to store and scale league-related data such as teams, schedules, scores, and user authentication. The backend provides a **REST API** that the frontend uses to fetch and update league information, ensuring scalability as the league grows.


## Frontend (`frontend/`)
The frontend is developed with **React**. It handles the **user interface and experience**, displaying league information, schedules, standings, and team details. The frontend communicates with the backend to retrieve and submit data. Our modern tech stack also makes it easy to implement role-based access control and store user information.
