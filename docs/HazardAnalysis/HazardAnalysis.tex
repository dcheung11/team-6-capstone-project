\section{Introduction}

\wss{You can include your definition of what a hazard is here.}

\section{Scope and Purpose of Hazard Analysis}

\wss{You should say what \textbf{loss} could be incurred because of the
hazards.}

\section{System Boundaries and Components}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{User Authentication and Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)}: This component manages login and role assignment (commissioner, captain, player) to ensure proper access to system functionalities.
    \item \textbf{Game Scheduling Component}: Responsible for generating, displaying, and updating the schedule for games, including handling rescheduling requests.
    \item \textbf{Game Result Reporting}: Allows team captains to report game results and scores, which are then used to update standings.
    \item \textbf{Team and Player Management}: Manages the creation of teams, player assignments, and tracking captain roles and rosters.
    \item \textbf{Standings and Ranking Calculation}: Computes team standings based on game results, including win/loss records and score tracking.
    \item \textbf{Database}: Centralized storage for users, teams, games, schedules, and standings.
    \item \textbf{External Payment Tracking}: Tracks the payment status of players, though actual payment processing is handled externally (e.g., through e-transfers).
    \item \textbf{Communication and Announcement System}: Allows commissioners to send league-wide announcements and updates to users.
\end{itemize}

\section{Critical Assumptions}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{User Authentication}: It is assumed that the authentication system using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for role-based access control will function reliably and securely, preventing unauthorized access.
    \item \textbf{External Payment System}: It is assumed that external payment tracking (via e-transfer) will be accurate, and users will report their payment status honestly, as payment processing is outside the scope of the system.
    \item \textbf{Internet Connectivity}: The platform assumes that all users (commissioners, captains, players) have stable internet access to interact with the system, especially when accessing schedules and reporting game results.
    \item \textbf{Manual Input of Game Results}: Captains are responsible for entering accurate game scores and results. The system assumes that no errors will occur during this process, and that any discrepancies will be addressed through manual oversight.
    \item \textbf{Data Integrity}: It is assumed that the database will maintain data integrity during read/write operations, especially when updating schedules, standings, and user details.
    \item \textbf{System Availability}: The platform assumes that the hosting server will remain consistently available, with minimal downtime, to ensure uninterrupted access for users.
\end{itemize}

\section{Failure Mode and Effect Analysis}

\wss{Include your FMEA table here. This is the most important part of this document.}
\wss{The safety requirements in the table do not have to have the prefix SR.
The most important thing is to show traceability to your SRS. You might trace to
requirements you have already written, or you might need to add new
requirements.}
\wss{If no safety requirement can be devised, other mitigation strategies can be
entered in the table, including strategies involving providing additional
documentation, and/or test cases.}

\section{Safety and Security Requirements}

\wss{Newly discovered requirements.  These should also be added to the SRS.  (A
rationale design process how and why to fake it.)}

\section{Roadmap}

\wss{Which safety requirements will be implemented as part of the capstone timeline?
Which requirements will be implemented in the future?}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item What went well while writing this deliverable? 
    \item What pain points did you experience during this deliverable, and how
    did you resolve them?
    \item Which of your listed risks had your team thought of before this
    deliverable, and which did you think of while doing this deliverable? For
    the latter ones (ones you thought of while doing the Hazard Analysis), how
    did they come about?
    \item Other than the risk of physical harm (some projects may not have any
    appreciable risks of this form), list at least 2 other types of risk in
    software products. Why are they important to consider?
\end{enumerate}
