\section{Introduction}
A hazard analysis identifies potential risks associated with software, assessing how they might impact safety, security, and performance. This process aims to prevent accidents, reduce risks, and ensure the reliability of the platform. For the McMaster GSA Softball League Platform, the analysis will focus on potential issues like user interactions, data handling, scheduling conflicts, and access controls, aiming to create a safe and dependable user experience.

\section{Scope and Purpose of Hazard Analysis}
This analysis covers the entire software system for the McMaster GSA Softball League Platform, including user functions, scheduling algorithms, data storage, and access control. The purpose is to pinpoint hazards that could lead to:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Data Loss:} Unintentional loss of user data, schedules, or game results.
    \item \textbf{Security Breaches:} Unauthorized access to sensitive information, like player details or team data.
    \item \textbf{Operational Disruptions:} Scheduling errors or system failures that cause conflicts or missed games.
    \item \textbf{User Frustration:} Confusing navigation, input errors, or difficulties in tracking payment status.
\end{itemize}
Addressing these risks early aims to make the platform safer, more reliable, and user-friendly.

\section{System Boundaries and Components}

\wss{Dividing the system into components will help you brainstorm the hazards.
You shouldn't do a full design of the components, just get a feel for the major
ones.  For projects that involve hardware, the components will typically include
each individual piece of hardware.  If your software will have a database, or an
important library, these are also potential components.}

\section{Critical Assumptions}

\wss{These assumptions that are made about the software or system.  You should
minimize the number of assumptions that remove potential hazards.  For instance,
you could assume a part will never fail, but it is generally better to include
this potential failure mode.}

\section{Failure Mode and Effect Analysis}

\wss{Include your FMEA table here. This is the most important part of this document.}
\wss{The safety requirements in the table do not have to have the prefix SR.
The most important thing is to show traceability to your SRS. You might trace to
requirements you have already written, or you might need to add new
requirements.}
\wss{If no safety requirement can be devised, other mitigation strategies can be
entered in the table, including strategies involving providing additional
documentation, and/or test cases.}

\section{Safety and Security Requirements}

\wss{Newly discovered requirements.  These should also be added to the SRS.  (A
rationale design process how and why to fake it.)}

\section{Roadmap}

\wss{Which safety requirements will be implemented as part of the capstone timeline?
Which requirements will be implemented in the future?}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item What went well while writing this deliverable? 
    \item What pain points did you experience during this deliverable, and how
    did you resolve them?
    \item Which of your listed risks had your team thought of before this
    deliverable, and which did you think of while doing this deliverable? For
    the latter ones (ones you thought of while doing the Hazard Analysis), how
    did they come about?
    \item Other than the risk of physical harm (some projects may not have any
    appreciable risks of this form), list at least 2 other types of risk in
    software products. Why are they important to consider?
\end{enumerate}
