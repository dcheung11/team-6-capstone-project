This document summarizes the contributions of each team member for the Rev 0
Demo.  The time period of interest is the time between the POC demo and the Rev
0 demo.

For this demo we plan to show our finished product. This includes the full
implementation of the functioning web application with sign-ups/logins, team
formation, schedule formation, rescheduling, and everything else that
is outlined in our requirements.

\section{CICD}

% \wss{Say how CICD is used in your project}

% \wss{If your team has additional metrics of productivity, please feel free to
%     add them to this report.}

CI/CD is mainly used in our project to build LaTeX pdf files when .tex
files are pushed. This is because documentation has been the majority
of our contribution and importance until now. We are working on  
incorporating a code/implementation related CI/CD now.
