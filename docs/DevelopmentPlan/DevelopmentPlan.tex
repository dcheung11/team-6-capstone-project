\wss{Put your introductory blurb here.  Often the blurb is a brief roadmap of
what is contained in the report.}

\wss{Additional information on the development plan can be found in the

\section{Confidential Information?}

\wss{State whether your project has confidential information from industry, or
not.  If there is confidential information, point to the agreement you have in
place.}

\wss{For most teams this section will just state that there is no confidential
information to protect.}
\section{IP to Protect}

\wss{State whether there is IP to protect.  If there is, point to the agreement.
All students who are working on a project that requires an IP agreement are also
required to sign the ``Intellectual Property Guide Acknowledgement.''}

\section{Copyright License}

\wss{What copyright license is your team adopting.  Point to the license in your
repo.}

\section{Team Meeting Plan}

\wss{How often will you meet? where?}

\wss{If the meeting is a physical location (not virtual), out of an abundance of
caution for safety reasons you shouldn't put the location online}

\wss{How often will you meet with your industry advisor?  when?  where?}

\wss{Will meetings be virtual?  At least some meetings should likely be
in-person.}

\wss{How will the meetings be structured?  There should be a chair for all meetings.  There should be an agenda for all meetings.}

\section{Team Communication Plan}

\wss{Issues on GitHub should be part of your communication plan.}

\section{Team Member Roles}

\wss{You should identify the types of roles you anticipate, like notetaker,
leader, meeting chair, reviewer.  Assigning specific people to those roles is
not necessary at this stage.  In a student team the role of the individuals will
likely change throughout the year.}

\section{Workflow Plan}

To ensure efficient collaboration and seamless project development, the following workflow processes will be adopted:

\subsection{Git Workflow}
The team will follow the Git Feature Branch Workflow, but instead of "feature" branches, we will refer to them as "task" branches to better reflect the variety of work being done (e.g., adding documentation, fixing bugs, or developing new features).

\begin{itemize}
    \item Main Branch: The main branch will always contain production-ready code. Only tested and approved code will be merged into this branch.
    \item Development Branch: All new tasks, whether for coding, documentation, or bug fixes, will be developed in task branches created from the development branch.
    \item Task Branches: Each new task (feature, bug fix, or documentation section) will have its own dedicated branch named descriptively (e.g., webpage-login-feature, webpage-signout-fix). This allows team members to work independently without affecting the main codebase.
    \item Pull Requests (PRs): Once a task is complete, the developer will submit a pull request (PR) to merge the code into the development branch. PRs must be reviewed by at least two rotating team members before merging to ensure code quality and consistency.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Issue Management}
\textbf{GitHub Issues} will be used to track tasks, bugs, and feature requests throughout the project. Each issue will:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Be clearly described, outlining the task, bug, or enhancement in detail.
    \item Include relevant labels to indicate priority (e.g., high, medium, low) and type (bug, task, improvement).
    \item Have a designated assignee to ensure accountability.
    \item Include milestones and deadlines where applicable.
\end{itemize}\par

\textbf{Issue Templates} will be created to standardize how issues are reported:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Bug Report Template: A form to report bugs, with fields for reproduction steps, expected behavior, and actual behavior.
    \item Task/Request Template: A form to describe tasks, such as documentation sections or new features, detailing the goal and steps for completion.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Continuous Integration (CI)}
The team will implementContinuous Integration (CI) to ensure that the code remains stable as new changes are introduced.
\begin{itemize}
    \item A basic CI pipeline (using a tool like \textbf{GitHub Actions}) will be configured to automatically run tests whenever a new pull request is opened. This will ensure that the new code doesnâ€™t break existing functionality or introduce bugs.
    \item The CI pipeline will run simple unit tests and style checks, ensuring the code is clean and functional.
    \item Only code that passes all CI checks will be eligible for merging into the development branch.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Code Review Process}
Every pull request will require at least two reviews from rotating team members before being merged.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Rotating Reviewers: Team members will take turns reviewing pull requests to ensure that everyone contributes to maintaining code quality.
    \item Review Feedback: Reviewers will provide constructive feedback through GitHub, and any requested changes must be implemented before approval.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{GitHub Projects \& Kanban Board}
The team will use \textbf{GitHub Projects} with a kanban board to visually track progress. GitHub Projects allows automatic creation of tasks on the Kanban board from GitHub Issues, ensuring that both issue tracking and task tracking are seamlessly integrated. The Kanban board will include the following columns:
\begin{itemize}
    \item To Do: Automatically populated with new issues created in GitHub.
    \item In Progress: Tasks/issues that are actively being worked on will be moved to this column.
    \item In Review: Pull requests awaiting review will be placed here.
    \item Completed: Once a task is fully completed and merged, it will be moved to the Completed column.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Task Assignment}
Tasks will be assigned via GitHub Issues and reflected on the kanban board. Team members can self-assign tasks or be assigned by the project manager. Larger tasks will be broken down into smaller sub-tasks to ensure steady progress. This process ensures that task assignment, status, and completion are always visible, helping the team stay on track and maintain accountability.

\section{Project Decomposition and Scheduling}

\begin{itemize}
  \item How will you be using GitHub projects?
  \item Include a link to your GitHub project
\end{itemize}

\wss{How will the project be scheduled?  This is the big picture schedule, not
details. You will need to reproduce information that is in the course outline
for deadlines.}

\section{Proof of Concept Demonstration Plan}

What is the main risk, or risks, for the success of your project?  What will you
demonstrate during your proof of concept demonstration to convince yourself that
you will be able to overcome this risk?

\section{Expected Technology}

\wss{What programming language or languages do you expect to use?  What external
libraries?  What frameworks?  What technologies.  Are there major components of
the implementation that you expect you will implement, despite the existence of
libraries that provide the required functionality.  For projects with machine
learning, will you use pre-trained models, or be training your own model?  }

\wss{The implementation decisions can, and likely will, change over the course
of the project.  The initial documentation should be written in an abstract way;
it should be agnostic of the implementation choices, unless the implementation
choices are project constraints.  However, recording our initial thoughts on
implementation helps understand the challenge level and feasibility of a
project.  It may also help with early identification of areas where project
members will need to augment their training.}

Topics to discuss include the following:

\begin{itemize}
\item Specific programming language
\item Specific libraries
\item Pre-trained models
\item Specific linter tool (if appropriate)
\item Specific unit testing framework
\item Investigation of code coverage measuring tools
\item Specific plans for Continuous Integration (CI), or an explanation that CI
  is not being done
\item Specific performance measuring tools (like Valgrind), if
  appropriate
\item Tools you will likely be using?
\end{itemize}

\wss{git, GitHub and GitHub projects should be part of your technology.}

\section{Coding Standard}

\wss{What coding standard will you adopt?}
