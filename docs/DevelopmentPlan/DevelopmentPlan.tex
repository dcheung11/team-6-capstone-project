\section{Team Meeting Plan}

The team will meet twice a week, with a strong emphasis on maintaining at least one in-person meeting whenever possible. Physical meeting locations and continuous discussion outside of meeting times will be communicated internally over text messaging or the team’s designated communication platform (Discord)\par

Meetings will be organized as follows:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Progress Meeting: Focused on updates, task delegation, and alignment on overall project goals (minimum 30 minutes).
  \item Working Session: Dedicated to collaborative tasks such as coding, debugging, and addressing technical challenges (minimum 1 hour).
\end{itemize}

\begin{flushleft}
  We will meet with our industry advisor biweekly to discuss progress and challenges. In-person meetings with our advisor will always be prioritized. During weeks when a deliverable is due, this meeting shall take place at least 2 days before the deadline to allow for necessary feedback and revisions. 
  In-person meetings will occur at Hatch when rooms are available for booking.
  Virtual meetings will be held over MS Teams. All meetings will be organized email with the industry advisor with at least 24 hours of notice.\par

  Meeting Structure:
\end{flushleft}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Meeting Chair: A rotating team member will serve as the chair for each meeting, responsible for maintaining structure and guiding discussions.
  \item Agenda: A predefined agenda will be prepared by the chair and shared with all team members at least 24 hours in advance. This will allow everyone to review and prepare for the meeting topics.
  \item Minutes: A designated notetaker (rotating role) will document key decisions, progress, and action items.
\end{itemize}

In case of emergencies or immediate concerns, impromptu meetings can be scheduled at short notice using text messaging or the team’s designated communication platform (Discord). These meetings will be used to address urgent issues that cannot wait until the next scheduled session.
\section{Team Communication Plan}

\wss{Issues on GitHub should be part of your communication plan.}

\section{Team Member Roles}

To ensure that responsibilities are clear and all aspects of the project are efficiently managed, the following roles will be defined for each stage of the project. These roles will rotate as needed to provide equal opportunities for team members to lead and contribute across different areas:

\subsection{Project Manager} 
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Oversee overall project progress and ensure deadlines are met.
    \item Coordinate tasks and delegate responsibilities to team members.
    \item Monitor team morale and ensure smooth collaboration.
  \end{itemize}

\subsection{Team Liaison}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Act as the primary point of contact with the faculty.
    \item Distribute and document all comminucation between the faculty to the rest of the members via text messaging or in an appropriate channel on Discord.
    \item Respond to emails from faculty in a timely manner and ensure all statements made to the faculty are approved by the rest of the group.
  \end{itemize}


\subsection{Meeting Chair} 
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Lead and structure team meetings.
    \item Prepare and distribute the meeting agenda at least 24 hours before the meeting.
    \item Ensure meetings stay on topic and follow the agenda.
    \item Facilitate discussions and ensure all team members are heard.
    \item Encourage participation from all members. Attempt to ask each member an engaging question at least once throughout the meeting.
  \end{itemize}

\subsection{Notetaker}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Take detailed notes during team and advisor meetings.
    \item Document key decisions, action items, and deadlines.
    \item Distribute meeting minutes promptly after each meeting in the appropriate Discord channel (within 24 hours).
  \end{itemize}

  \subsection{Code Reviewer}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Review code submitted by team members via GitHub pull requests to ensure quality and consistency.
    \item Provide constructive feedback and suggest improvements to ensure best practices are followed.
    \item Ensure the code adheres to the team's coding standards and works as expected.
  \end{itemize}

\subsection{Documentation Lead}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Maintain and update project documentation, including the development plan, technical documentation, and user guides.
    \item Ensure that all team members contribute to the documentation as needed.
    \item Lead final reports and project summaries required for deliverables.
    \item Stay informed and up to date to act as an informant for other group members.
  \end{itemize}

\section{Workflow Plan}

To ensure efficient collaboration and seamless project development, the following workflow processes will be adopted:

\subsection{Git Workflow}
The team will follow the Git Feature Branch Workflow, but instead of "feature" branches, we will refer to them as "task" branches to better reflect the variety of work being done (e.g., adding documentation, fixing bugs, or developing new features).

\begin{itemize}
    \item Main Branch: The main branch will always contain production-ready code. Only tested and approved code will be merged into this branch.
    \item Development Branch: All new tasks, whether for coding, documentation, or bug fixes, will be developed in task branches created from the development branch.
    \item Task Branches: Each new task (feature, bug fix, or documentation section) will have its own dedicated branch named descriptively (e.g., webpage-login-feature, webpage-signout-fix). This allows team members to work independently without affecting the main codebase.
    \item Pull Requests (PRs): Once a task is complete, the developer will submit a pull request (PR) to merge the code into the development branch. PRs must be reviewed by at least two rotating team members before merging to ensure code quality and consistency.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Issue Management}
\textbf{GitHub Issues} will be used to track tasks, bugs, and feature requests throughout the project. Each issue will:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Be clearly described, outlining the task, bug, or enhancement in detail.
    \item Include relevant labels to indicate priority (e.g., high, medium, low) and type (bug, task, improvement).
    \item Have a designated assignee to ensure accountability.
    \item Include milestones and deadlines where applicable.
\end{itemize}\par

\textbf{Issue Templates} will be created to standardize how issues are reported:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Bug Report Template: A form to report bugs, with fields for reproduction steps, expected behavior, and actual behavior.
    \item Task/Request Template: A form to describe tasks, such as documentation sections or new features, detailing the goal and steps for completion.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Continuous Integration (CI)}
The team will implementContinuous Integration (CI) to ensure that the code remains stable as new changes are introduced.
\begin{itemize}
    \item A basic CI pipeline (using a tool like \textbf{GitHub Actions}) will be configured to automatically run tests whenever a new pull request is opened. This will ensure that the new code doesn’t break existing functionality or introduce bugs.
    \item The CI pipeline will run simple unit tests and style checks, ensuring the code is clean and functional.
    \item Only code that passes all CI checks will be eligible for merging into the development branch.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Code Review Process}
Every pull request will require at least two reviews from rotating team members before being merged.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Rotating Reviewers: Team members will take turns reviewing pull requests to ensure that everyone contributes to maintaining code quality.
    \item Review Feedback: Reviewers will provide constructive feedback through GitHub, and any requested changes must be implemented before approval.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{GitHub Projects \& Kanban Board}
The team will use \textbf{GitHub Projects} with a kanban board to visually track progress. GitHub Projects allows automatic creation of tasks on the Kanban board from GitHub Issues, ensuring that both issue tracking and task tracking are seamlessly integrated. The Kanban board will include the following columns:
\begin{itemize}
    \item To Do: Automatically populated with new issues created in GitHub.
    \item In Progress: Tasks/issues that are actively being worked on will be moved to this column.
    \item In Review: Pull requests awaiting review will be placed here.
    \item Completed: Once a task is fully completed and merged, it will be moved to the Completed column.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Task Assignment}
Tasks will be assigned via GitHub Issues and reflected on the kanban board. Team members can self-assign tasks or be assigned by the project manager. Larger tasks will be broken down into smaller sub-tasks to ensure steady progress. This process ensures that task assignment, status, and completion are always visible, helping the team stay on track and maintain accountability.

\section{Project Decomposition and Scheduling}

\begin{itemize}
  \item How will you be using GitHub projects?
  \item Include a link to your GitHub project
\end{itemize}

\wss{How will the project be scheduled?  This is the big picture schedule, not
details. You will need to reproduce information that is in the course outline
for deadlines.}

\section{Proof of Concept Demonstration Plan}

\subsection{Project Risks}

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Login, Registration, and User Roles:} Establishing a secure login and registration system while ensuring proper role assignments for users, captains, commissioner levels can present challenges, particularly in preventing unauthorized access and special permissions.
  \item \textbf{Scheduling:} Managing game schedules across multiple divisions and handling rescheduling due to conflicts can introduce complexities in both logic and user interface design. It may be tricky to implement schedule generation, game rescheduling, team preferences, etc. Some research on schedule generation is required.
  \item \textbf{Deployment and Scalability:} Deploying the application in a secure and stable manner also entails ensuring the platform is reliable under real-world conditions, especially as traffic increases during the season, and that updates or patches don’t introduce bugs or downtime. Approximately 1000 unique participants across 30-40 teams are using the current web page, and scalability must be acknowledged in design and implementation.
  \item \textbf{Roster Management:} Difficulty in implementing the "Request To Join Team" functionality for players and sending email notifications to the captains, as well as general roster management available to the captain.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Proof of Concept Demonstration}

To address these risks, the PoC demonstration will focus on the following key areas to mitigate these concerns:

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Login, Registration, and User Roles:} \\ Goal: A working registration page where users can create accounts, log in, and see different views based on their roles. A demo admin will be able to access restricted settings while regular users can only view their team pages. 
  \item \textbf{Scheduling:} \\ Goal: A minimal working scheduling system that auto-generates a schedule for all divisions with an interface allowing captains to request a rescheduled game and set the preferred time slots.
  \item \textbf{Deployment and Scalability:} \\ Goal: A live deployment of the minimal POC on Heroku or similar hosting platforms, demonstrating real-time accessibility and showcasing a the ability for simultaneous user interactions with the platform.
  \item \textbf{Roster Management:} \\ Goal: Demonstrate a simple roster management interface where team captains can invite (and manage) players, with a live update of the team's roster, and players can request to join teams, notifying the captain. 
\end{itemize}

\section{Expected Technology}

\wss{What programming language or languages do you expect to use?  What external
libraries?  What frameworks?  What technologies.  Are there major components of
the implementation that you expect you will implement, despite the existence of
libraries that provide the required functionality.  For projects with machine
learning, will you use pre-trained models, or be training your own model?  }

\wss{The implementation decisions can, and likely will, change over the course
of the project.  The initial documentation should be written in an abstract way;
it should be agnostic of the implementation choices, unless the implementation
choices are project constraints.  However, recording our initial thoughts on
implementation helps understand the challenge level and feasibility of a
project.  It may also help with early identification of areas where project
members will need to augment their training.}

Topics to discuss include the following:

\begin{itemize}
\item Specific programming language
\item Specific libraries
\item Pre-trained models
\item Specific linter tool (if appropriate)
\item Specific unit testing framework
\item Investigation of code coverage measuring tools
\item Specific plans for Continuous Integration (CI), or an explanation that CI
  is not being done
\item Specific performance measuring tools (like Valgrind), if
  appropriate
\item Tools you will likely be using?
\end{itemize}

\wss{git, GitHub and GitHub projects should be part of your technology.}

    \item Non-urgent personal commitments (e.g., social events, non-critical errands).
    \item Lack of preparation for the meeting.
    \item Laziness.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{In Case of Emergency}

Our teams process for emergencies:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The team member must inform the team as soon as possible through the groupchat explaining their situation.
    \item If the team member cannot attend the meeting, they should provide a brief update on their progress or any relevant information so the team can continue without them (as soon as safely and conveniently possible).
    \item In the case that a deadline cannot be met, the team member must alert the team and the team will confer on the urgency of the task and reassign tasks accordingly.
    \item For major deliverables, the team may confer to try to accommodate a reasonable extension. Team members are expected to be willing to collaborate and contribute extra work to help cover for the lost time from the emergency and put the team first.
    
\end{itemize}
In case of prolonged emergencies, the team will review the situation and may reassign responsibilities to ensure the project remains on track.


\subsection*{Accountability and Teamwork}

\subsubsection*{Quality} 

Our teams process and expectations for quality:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Each team member is expected to come fully prepared for meetings, having completed any assigned tasks and ideation processes. 
    \item Deliverables and tasks should be done to the best of the team member's abilities.
    \item At least one other team member will have reviewed each task. If a task is below the teams accepted quality, the reviewer is expected to respectfully bring it to the attention of the team and suggest improvements.
    \item Team members are expected to provide constructive criticism to other team members, and team members are expected to handle the feedback professionally. 
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Attitude}

Our teams process and expectations for attitude:

    \item Team members should be expected to be willing to help out on other member's tasks, providing feedback and support (within reason).
    \item Team members should follow the code of conduct and conflict resolution plans from Harvard University:  https://hr.harvard.edu/staff-personnel-manual/employee-conduct
\end{itemize}


\subsubsection*{Stay on Track}

To keep the team on track, we will:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Have weekly progress check-ins to ensure tasks are being completed as expected.
    \item Set specific target metrics, such as attendance, commits, and task completion. 
\end{itemize}

If any team member misses a meeting without reason, they have to bring coffee at the next meeting.

\subsubsection*{Team Building}

To build team cohesion, we will organize at least 2 team-building activities over the course of the Capstone course and begin meetings with a personal check-in.

\subsubsection*{Decision Making} 

Our team will aim for decision-making by consensus, where every member's opinion is considered. In situations where consensus cannot be reached, we will vote, with the majority decision winning. For significant disputes, we will seek input from the project TA or instructor to guide the final resolution.
