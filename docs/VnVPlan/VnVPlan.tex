\wss{The intention of the VnV plan is to increase confidence in the software.
However, this does not mean listing every verification and validation technique
that has ever been devised.  The VnV plan should also be a \textbf{feasible}
plan. Execution of the plan should be possible with the time and team available.
If the full plan cannot be completed during the time available, it can either be
modified to ``fake it'', or a better solution is to add a section describing
what work has been completed and what work is still planned for the future.}

\wss{The VnV plan is typically started after the requirements stage, but before
the design stage.  This means that the sections related to unit testing cannot
initially be completed.  The sections will be filled in after the design stage
is complete.  the final version of the VnV plan should have all sections filled
in.}

  Verification and Validation plan}

\section{General Information}

\subsection{Summary}

\wss{Say what software is being tested.  Give its name and a brief overview of
  its general functions.}

\subsection{Objectives}

\wss{State what is intended to be accomplished.  The objective will be around
  the qualities that are most important for your project.  You might have
  something like: ``build confidence in the software correctness,''
  ``demonstrate adequate usability.'' etc.  You won't list all of the qualities,
  just those that are most important.}

\wss{You should also list the objectives that are out of scope.  You don't have 
the resources to do everything, so what will you be leaving out.  For instance, 
if you are not going to verify the quality of usability, state this.  It is also 
worthwhile to justify why the objectives are left out.}

\wss{The objectives are important because they highlight that you are aware of 
limitations in your resources for verification and validation.  You can't do everything, 
so what are you going to prioritize?  As an example, if your system depends on an 
external library, you can explicitly state that you will assume that external library 
has already been verified by its implementation team.}

\subsection{Challenge Level and Extras}

\wss{State the challenge level (advanced, general, basic) for your project.
Your challenge level should exactly match what is included in your problem
statement.  This should be the challenge level agreed on between you and the
course instructor.  You can use a pull request to update your challenge level
(in TeamComposition.csv or Repos.csv) if your plan changes as a result of the
VnV planning exercise.}

\wss{Summarize the extras (if any) that were tackled by this project.  Extras
can include usability testing, code walkthroughs, user documentation, formal
proof, GenderMag personas, Design Thinking, etc.  Extras should have already
been approved by the course instructor as included in your problem statement.
You can use a pull request to update your extras (in TeamComposition.csv or
Repos.csv) if your plan changes as a result of the VnV planning exercise.}

\subsection{Relevant Documentation}

\wss{Reference relevant documentation.  This will definitely include your SRS
  and your other project documents (design documents, like MG, MIS, etc).  You
  can include these even before they are written, since by the time the project
  is done, they will be written.  You can create BibTeX entries for your
  documents and within those entries include a hyperlink to the documents.}

\citet{SRS}

\wss{Don't just list the other documents.  You should explain why they are relevant and 
how they relate to your VnV efforts.}

\section{Plan}

\wss{Introduce this section.  You can provide a roadmap of the sections to
  come.}

\subsection{Verification and Validation Team}

\wss{Your teammates.  Maybe your supervisor.
  You should do more than list names.  You should say what each person's role is
  for the project's verification.  A table is a good way to summarize this information.}

\subsection{SRS Verification Plan}

\wss{List any approaches you intend to use for SRS verification.  This may
  include ad hoc feedback from reviewers, like your classmates (like your
  primary reviewer), or you may plan for something more rigorous/systematic.}

\wss{If you have a supervisor for the project, you shouldn't just say they will
read over the SRS.  You should explain your structured approach to the review.
Will you have a meeting?  What will you present?  What questions will you ask?
Will you give them instructions for a task-based inspection?  Will you use your
issue tracker?}

\wss{Maybe create an SRS checklist?}

\subsection{Design Verification Plan}

\wss{Plans for design verification}

\wss{The review will include reviews by your classmates}

\wss{Create a checklists?}

\subsection{Verification and Validation Plan Verification Plan}

\wss{The verification and validation plan is an artifact that should also be
verified.  Techniques for this include review and mutation testing.}

\wss{The review will include reviews by your classmates}

\wss{Create a checklists?}

\subsection{Implementation Verification Plan}

\wss{You should at least point to the tests listed in this document and the unit
  testing plan.}

\wss{In this section you would also give any details of any plans for static
  verification of the implementation.  Potential techniques include code
  walkthroughs, code inspection, static analyzers, etc.}

\wss{The final class presentation in CAS 741 could be used as a code
walkthrough.  There is also a possibility of using the final presentation (in
CAS741) for a partial usability survey.}

\subsection{Automated Testing and Verification Tools}

\wss{What tools are you using for automated testing.  Likely a unit testing
  framework and maybe a profiling tool, like ValGrind.  Other possible tools
  include a static analyzer, make, continuous integration tools, test coverage
  tools, etc.  Explain your plans for summarizing code coverage metrics.
  Linters are another important class of tools.  For the programming language
  you select, you should look at the available linters.  There may also be tools
  that verify that coding standards have been respected, like flake9 for
  Python.}

\wss{If you have already done this in the development plan, you can point to
that document.}

\wss{The details of this section will likely evolve as you get closer to the
  implementation.}

\subsection{Software Validation Plan}

\wss{If there is any external data that can be used for validation, you should
  point to it here.  If there are no plans for validation, you should state that
  here.}

\wss{You might want to use review sessions with the stakeholder to check that
the requirements document captures the right requirements.  Maybe task based
inspection?}

\wss{For those capstone teams with an external supervisor, the Rev 0 demo should 
be used as an opportunity to validate the requirements.  You should plan on 
demonstrating your project to your supervisor shortly after the scheduled Rev 0 demo.  
The feedback from your supervisor will be very useful for improving your project.}

\wss{For teams without an external supervisor, user testing can serve the same purpose 
as a Rev 0 demo for the supervisor.}

\wss{This section might reference back to the SRS verification section.}

\section{System Tests}

This section goes over the tests for both functional and non-functional requirements of the platform. Functional requirements tests cover core features like authentication, team management, and scheduling. These tests are focused on making sure the system does exactly what it’s supposed to, based on the requirements laid out in the SRS.

The non-functional requirements tests are split into categories to check additional qualities of the system: Look and Feel, Usability and Humanity, Performance, Operational and Environmental, Maintainability and Support, and Security. These tests make sure the platform isn’t just functional but also user-friendly, reliable, compatible across devices, and secure. Each section breaks down the tests and criteria we’ll use to evaluate these areas.

\subsection{Tests for Functional Requirements}

This section is divided into different areas to cover subsets of the functional requirements comprehensively. The following tests cover core features like authentication, team management, and scheduling. References to the SRS are provided to show the alignment with documented requirements.

It should be noted that when \texttt{Roles} are described doing actions in the functional tests (e.g. ``Captain inputs...''), these are assumed a tester acting in place of the role. 

\subsubsection{Authentication and Access Control}

This section includes tests related to the authentication of users and the enforcement of role-based access control. These tests cover requirements related to login functionality and role-specific permissions as outlined in the SRS data model. This section coveres SRS Req \#1

\paragraph{Login with Invalid Credentials}

\begin{enumerate}
\item{FR-1\\}
Control: Manual

Initial State: System at login screen, ready to accept credentials.

Input: Invalid \texttt{UserID} and a combination of valid \texttt{UserID} + Invalid \texttt{Password} for commissioner, captain, and player accounts.

Output: Unsuccessful login. The system is ready to accept new credentials.

Test Case Derivation: Invalid login credentials should result in an unsuccessful login and the user should be able to try again.

How Test Will Be Performed: Tester will attempt to log in with an invalid \texttt{UserID} and \texttt{Password}. Verify that all invalid logins are unsuccessful.

Requirements Covered: SRS Req \#1 (authentication).
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Login with Valid Credentials}

\begin{enumerate}

\item{FR-2\\}
Control: Manual

Initial State: System at login screen, ready to accept credentials.

Input: \texttt{UserID} and \texttt{Password} for valid commissioner, captain, and player accounts.

Output: Successful login for valid credentials.

Test Case Derivation: Valid login credentials should result in a successful login to the system. This is also how the system will differentiate users to perform actions requiring Role permissions.

How Test Will Be Performed: Tester will log in with a valid \texttt{UserID} and Password for each \texttt{Role} (Player, Captain, Commissioner) and verify access to the platform after successful login under the correct account.

Requirements Covered: SRS Req \#1 (authentication).
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Team Management}

This section includes tests for the functionality of team creation and management. These tests verify that captains can create teams with unique names, manage join requests, and prevent duplication errors. This section also includes tests for the functionality allowing players to browse and request to join teams. These tests confirm that players can request to join a team and that requests are accurately reflected to captains. This section covers SRS Req \#5 and \#6.

\paragraph{Captain Registering a Team}

\begin{enumerate}

\item{FR-3\\}
Control: Manual

Initial State: User is logged in with Role set to Captain, with no existing team associated with \texttt{CaptainID}. System is on the create team page, with at least one team registered in the database.

Input: Enter a \texttt{TeamName} that already exists in the database and a Division.

Output: Unsuccessful creation of a team with a duplicate \texttt{TeamName}. Error message displayed to Captain addressing that the \texttt{TeamName} already exists.

Test Case Derivation: As a general rule, there are to be no duplicate \texttt{TeamName}. Captains should not be able to create a team with a \texttt{TeamName} that is already taken

How Test Will Be Performed: Tester (with Captain account) submits a request to create a new team using a duplicate \texttt{TeamName}. Verify that the team is not added to the database.

Requirements Covered: SRS Req \#5 (team creation).

\item{FR-4\\}
Control: Manual

Initial State: User is logged in with Role set to Captain, with no existing team associated with \texttt{CaptainID}. System is on the create team page.

Input: Enter a unique TeamName and Division.

Output: Successful team creation after submission.

Test Case Derivation: With valid input, Captains should be able to register their team into the system.

How Test Will Be Performed: Captain creates a valid new team. Verify that the team is created and added to the database. New entry should include \texttt{TeamID, TeamName, Division, CaptainID, Roster}.

Requirements Covered: SRS Req \#5 (team creation).

\item{FR-5\\}
Control: Manual

Initial State: User logged in with Role set to Captain, with an existing team associated with \texttt{CaptainID}. System is on the create team page.

Input: Enter a new TeamName and Division.

Output: Unsuccessful creation of a team. Error message displayed for multiple teams under one \texttt{CaptainID}.

Test Case Derivation: As a general rule, Captains only have one team. Captains should not be able to create a new team when they already have one registered under their \texttt{CaptainID}.

How Test Will Be Performed: Captain attempts to create a second team. Verify that the team is not entered in the database.

Requirements Covered: SRS Req \#5 (team creation).
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Joining a Team}

Output: Game report is updated and Standings are updated (\texttt{TeamID, Wins, Losses, Ties, Rank}).

Test Case Derivation: Captains should be able to report game results which should be reflected in the platform's standings/reporting.

How Test Will Be Performed: Captain reports games. Verify that the report is reflected in database and that standings are automatically updated accordingly.

Requirements Covered: SRS Req \#12 (Reporting).

\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Rescheduling}

\begin{enumerate}

\item{FR-9\\}
Control: Manual

Initial State: Season schedule is generated and displayed, with commissioner and captain logged in. System is on scheduling page.

Input: Captain submits a reschedule request in an open slot. The request is valid and associated with the appropriate \texttt{ScheduleID, GameID, and SlotNumber}.

Output: Request is sent to Commissioner.

Test Case Derivation: Rescheduling requests from captains should be sent to the Comissioner for review and approval.

How Test Will Be Performed: Captain initiates reschedule request. Verify that the request is sent to the commissioner for approval.

Requirements Covered: SRS Req \#8 (rescheduling).

\item{FR-10\\}
Control: Manual

Initial State: Commissioner logged in. System is on schedule page with a scheduled game entry available.

Input: Commissioner applies an override (cancel or reschedule) on an existing \texttt{GameID} or approves a reschedule request.

Output: Override is reflected in the schedule. Notifications are sent to all IDs in \texttt{Roster} of teams associated with the overridden game.

Test Case Derivation: Schedule changes should be reflected in all affected user’s view and they should be notified of the changes.

How Test Will Be Performed: Commissioner applies an override on an existing game. Verify the game change (\texttt{Schedule view, SlotNumber}, and \texttt{Available Slots} are updated). Verify notifications are received by both teams.

Requirements Covered: SRS Req \#11 (game overrides).

\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Announcements}

Requirements Covered: SRS Req \#9, \#10 (announcements).
\end{enumerate}

...

\subsection{Tests for Nonfunctional Requirements}

\wss{The nonfunctional requirements for accuracy will likely just reference the
  appropriate functional tests from above.  The test cases should mention
  reporting the relative error for these tests.  Not all projects will
  necessarily have nonfunctional requirements related to accuracy.}

\wss{For some nonfunctional tests, you won't be setting a target threshold for
passing the test, but rather describing the experiment you will do to measure
the quality for different inputs.  For instance, you could measure speed versus
the problem size.  The output of the test isn't pass/fail, but rather a summary
table or graph.}

\wss{Tests related to usability could include conducting a usability test and
  survey.  The survey will be in the Appendix.}

\wss{Static tests, review, inspections, and walkthroughs, will not follow the
format for the tests given below.}

\wss{If you introduce static tests in your plan, you need to provide details.
How will they be done?  In cases like code (or document) walkthroughs, who will
be involved? Be specific.}

\subsection{Traceability Between Test Cases and Requirements}

\wss{Provide a table that shows which test cases are supporting which
  requirements.}

\section{Unit Test Description}

\wss{This section should not be filled in until after the MIS (detailed design
  document) has been completed.}

\wss{Reference your MIS (detailed design document) and explain your overall
philosophy for test case selection.}  

\wss{To save space and time, it may be an option to provide less detail in this section.  
For the unit tests you can potentially layout your testing strategy here.  That is, you 
can explain how tests will be selected for each module.  For instance, your test building 
approach could be test cases for each access program, including one test for normal behaviour 
and as many tests as needed for edge cases.  Rather than create the details of the input 
and output here, you could point to the unit testing code.  For this to work, you code 
needs to be well-documented, with meaningful names for all of the tests.}

\subsection{Unit Testing Scope}

\wss{What modules are outside of the scope.  If there are modules that are
  developed by someone else, then you would say here if you aren't planning on
  verifying them.  There may also be modules that are part of your software, but
  have a lower priority for verification than others.  If this is the case,
  explain your rationale for the ranking of module importance.}

\subsection{Tests for Functional Requirements}

\wss{Most of the verification will be through automated unit testing.  If
  appropriate specific modules can be verified by a non-testing based
  technique.  That can also be documented in this section.}

\subsubsection{Module 1}

\wss{Include a blurb here to explain why the subsections below cover the module.
  References to the MIS would be good.  You will want tests from a black box
  perspective and from a white box perspective.  Explain to the reader how the
  tests were selected.}

\begin{enumerate}

\item{test-id1\\}

Type: \wss{Functional, Dynamic, Manual, Automatic, Static etc. Most will
  be automatic}
					
Initial State:

How test will be performed: 

\item{...\\}
    
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Module 2}

\subsection{Tests for Nonfunctional Requirements}

\wss{If there is a module that needs to be independently assessed for
  performance, those test cases can go here.  In some projects, planning for
  nonfunctional tests of units will not be that relevant.}

\wss{These tests may involve collecting performance data from previously
  mentioned functional tests.}

\subsubsection{Module ?}
		
\begin{enumerate}

\item{test-id1\\}

\section*{Appendix --- Reflection}

\wss{This section is not required for CAS 741}

The information in this section will be used to evaluate the team members on the
graduate attribute of Lifelong Learning.

\begin{enumerate}
	\item What went well while writing this deliverable?
	
	There was a lot of effective communication and problem solving throughout the
	development of the VnV plan. The team was able to develop clear sections and 
	specific testing categories for features such as the authentication, access
	control, game scheduling, etc. This made is easier to organize the structure
	of the document. Using a google doc, the team was able to create an intial 
	draft with tasks assigned to team members either individually, or in sub groups.
	Following the creation of the ideas brainstormed in the draft, we created a 
	formal documentation of the VnV plan utilizing LaTeX.
  
	\item What pain points did you experience during this deliverable, and how
	  did you resolve them?
  
	  A challenge we faced during the formulation of this deliverable was ensuring
	  the traceability between test cases and requirements listed in section 4.4. 
	  The process of tracking each requirements to their respective test cases can
	  easily become complex. To resolve this issue, we established a mapping method
	  to simplify the traceability.
  
	\item What knowledge and skills will the team collectively need to acquire to
	successfully complete the verification and validation of your project?
	Examples of possible knowledge and skills include dynamic testing knowledge,
	static testing knowledge, specific tool usage, Valgrind etc.  You should look to
	identify at least one item for each team member.
  
	  \textbf{Static and dynamic testing knowledge} will be an important skill the
	  team will collectively need for the completion of verification and validation.
	   Thiw will be critical for validating both functional and non functional
	   requirements.
  
	   \textbf{Usability and performance testing} will be a necessary skill for the 
	   verification and validation, as it will be essential for the understanding
	   of the human factors and performance for the non functional requirements.
  
	   \textbf{Security testing} will be an important topic for the completion of
	   this deliverable due to the teams emphasis on security. A proper
	   understanding of cybersecurity principles will help improve the security.
  
	\item For each of the knowledge areas and skills identified in the previous
	question, what are at least two approaches to acquiring the knowledge or
	mastering the skill?  Of the identified approaches, which will each team
	member pursue, and why did they make this choice?
  
	\textbf{Static and dynamic testing knowledge} 
	\begin{enumerate}
	  \item Taking an online course with a focus on software testing methods.
	  \item Organize a peer learning session where team members individually
	  search and share various testing techniques.
	\end{enumerate}
	\textbf{Usability and performance testing} 
	\begin{enumerate}
	  \item Evaluate our perfomance matrix using analytical tools.
	  \item Learn more about UX/UI principles using online resources.
	\end{enumerate}
	\textbf{Security testing}
	\begin{enumerate}
	  \item Enroll in a cybersecurity course to learn core concepts.
	  \item Learn more about common vulnerablities and techniques to mitigate them
	\end{enumerate}
