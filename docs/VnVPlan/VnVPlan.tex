\wss{The intention of the VnV plan is to increase confidence in the software.
However, this does not mean listing every verification and validation technique
that has ever been devised.  The VnV plan should also be a \textbf{feasible}
plan. Execution of the plan should be possible with the time and team available.
If the full plan cannot be completed during the time available, it can either be
modified to ``fake it'', or a better solution is to add a section describing
what work has been completed and what work is still planned for the future.}

\wss{The VnV plan is typically started after the requirements stage, but before
the design stage.  This means that the sections related to unit testing cannot
initially be completed.  The sections will be filled in after the design stage
is complete.  the final version of the VnV plan should have all sections filled
in.}

  Verification and Validation plan}

\section{General Information}

\subsection{Summary}

\wss{Say what software is being tested.  Give its name and a brief overview of
  its general functions.}

\subsection{Objectives}

\wss{State what is intended to be accomplished.  The objective will be around
  the qualities that are most important for your project.  You might have
  something like: ``build confidence in the software correctness,''
  ``demonstrate adequate usability.'' etc.  You won't list all of the qualities,
  just those that are most important.}

\wss{You should also list the objectives that are out of scope.  You don't have 
the resources to do everything, so what will you be leaving out.  For instance, 
if you are not going to verify the quality of usability, state this.  It is also 
worthwhile to justify why the objectives are left out.}

\wss{The objectives are important because they highlight that you are aware of 
limitations in your resources for verification and validation.  You can't do everything, 
so what are you going to prioritize?  As an example, if your system depends on an 
external library, you can explicitly state that you will assume that external library 
has already been verified by its implementation team.}

\subsection{Challenge Level and Extras}

\wss{State the challenge level (advanced, general, basic) for your project.
Your challenge level should exactly match what is included in your problem
statement.  This should be the challenge level agreed on between you and the
course instructor.  You can use a pull request to update your challenge level
(in TeamComposition.csv or Repos.csv) if your plan changes as a result of the
VnV planning exercise.}

\wss{Summarize the extras (if any) that were tackled by this project.  Extras
can include usability testing, code walkthroughs, user documentation, formal
proof, GenderMag personas, Design Thinking, etc.  Extras should have already
been approved by the course instructor as included in your problem statement.
You can use a pull request to update your extras (in TeamComposition.csv or
Repos.csv) if your plan changes as a result of the VnV planning exercise.}

\subsection{Relevant Documentation}

\wss{Reference relevant documentation.  This will definitely include your SRS
  and your other project documents (design documents, like MG, MIS, etc).  You
  can include these even before they are written, since by the time the project
  is done, they will be written.  You can create BibTeX entries for your
  documents and within those entries include a hyperlink to the documents.}

\citet{SRS}

\wss{Don't just list the other documents.  You should explain why they are relevant and 
how they relate to your VnV efforts.}

\section{Plan}

\subsection{Verification and Validation Team}

V\&V Team Lead: Derek
\begin{itemize}
    \item Oversees the entire verification and validation process and ensures all activities are completed according to the plan.
    \item Coordinates with other members to align V\&V activities with project deadlines.
    \item deadlines.
Reviews and approves test plans, reports, and results.
    \item Researches and ensures that the team has the tools needed for testing.
\end{itemize}

\noindent Developers: Emma, Damien, Temituoyo, Jad
\begin{itemize}
    \item Develop code and conduct unit testing to ensure basic functionality
    \item Address any defects or issues they identified during testing
    \item Participate in code reviews and provide feedback to ensure code implementation is of high quality
    \item Assists in setting up automated testing frameworks
\end{itemize}

\subsection{SRS Verification Plan}

\noindent Our approach for SRS verification involves understanding the following objectives:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Validate that the SRS covers the project’s functional and non-functional requirements
    \item Verify that requirements are clearly defined, consistent and testable
    \item Validate that requirements are feasible and achievable within project constraints
\end{itemize}

After understanding these objectives, we will prioritize the following steps:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Have a team meeting and brainstorm all use case scenarios and requirements before meeting with our supervisor. We can make a SRS checklist to do this.
    \item Conduct a peer review with another team. For our capstone, another team is also doing the same project, so it will be best to work with them.
    \item Book a meeting with our supervisor and present the following use cases and requirements our platform covers.
    \item Discuss possible use cases and requirements with our supervisor. We can add these new ideas to our SRS checklist.
    
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Design Verification Plan}

Verification Methods:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Code Reviews 
        \\ \\Team members can conduct code reviews regularly to focus on code readability, efficiency, and to ensure that our code meets design requirements and specifications.
    \item Automated Testing
        \\ \\By using an automated testing framework, we can simulate real user interactions, such as signing up for the league. These testing scripts can be run quickly and save us time.
    \item Manual Testing
        \\ \\ We can conduct testing with users involved in the league to gather feedback and ensure that the platform meets user expectations.
    \item Performance Testing
        \\ \\Check website performance under heavy load and traffic to meet user expectations. An example would be how the website runs when multiple users register teams at the same time.
    \item Security Testing
        \\ \\Check for potential security issues, such as SQL injection to prevent data from being stolen.
    \item Data Verification
        \\ \\Verify that data is being stored, retrieved, and updated accurately in our database to prevent errors and meet user expectations.
    \item Documentation Review
        \\ \\Update documentation frequently, such as user guides, system diagrams, etc. to enforce updated knowledge throughout the team.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Implementation Verification Plan}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Code Walkthroughs
    \\ \\ Developers of a segment of code will share and present it to peers. The main focus here is design principles and coding standards.

    \item Code Inspections
    \\ \\ Peers will inspect code to find possible ways for optimization.

    \item Static Analyzers
    \\ \\ Use linting tools, such as ESLint to detect syntax errors and uphold standard code practices.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Automated Testing and Verification Tools}

\noindent Primary Testing Tool: Playwright\\

\noindent Playwright is the most modern end-to-end testing framework. It can support testing across different browsers like Chrome, Firefox, and Safari. The support that this framework has is ideal for ensuring that our platform works smoothly across various devices and browsers.\\

\noindent Compared to other testing frameworks, Playwright offers faster execution, and built-in capabilities for handling complex UI interactions like pop-ups, a fast and growing online community, and Microsoft, a tech giant, backs it up. \\

\noindent Linting Tool: ESLint\\

\noindent ESLint will be used to catch potential issues in the code, such as syntax errors, security vulnerabilities, or deviations from coding standards, before execution.\\

\noindent Saves time in code reviews and reduces the risk of runtime errors by enforcing best practices during development.

\subsection{Software Validation Plan}

Methods: \\

\begin{itemize}
    \item Requirement-Based Testing
    \\ \\ Create test cases based on requirements to verify that each functionality works as expected.
    
    \item Regression Testing
    \\ \\ Ensure basic functionality remains unaffected when developing new features by running a script that tests all the basic functionalities before updates are pushed.

    \item Device Testing
    \\ \\ Validate that the platform works across various devices, such as smartphones, tablets, desktops, etc.

    \item Cross-browser Testing
    \\ \\ Validate that the platform works across various browsers,
    such as Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc.
    
\end{itemize}

\section{System Tests}

This section goes over the tests for both functional and non-functional requirements of the platform. Functional requirements tests cover core features like authentication, team management, and scheduling. These tests are focused on making sure the system does exactly what it’s supposed to, based on the requirements laid out in the SRS.

The non-functional requirements tests are split into categories to check additional qualities of the system: Look and Feel, Usability and Humanity, Performance, Operational and Environmental, Maintainability and Support, and Security. These tests make sure the platform isn’t just functional but also user-friendly, reliable, compatible across devices, and secure. Each section breaks down the tests and criteria we’ll use to evaluate these areas.

\subsection{Tests for Functional Requirements}

This section is divided into different areas to cover subsets of the functional requirements comprehensively. The following tests cover core features like authentication, team management, and scheduling. References to the SRS are provided to show the alignment with documented requirements.

It should be noted that when \texttt{Roles} are described doing actions in the functional tests (e.g. ``Captain inputs...''), these are assumed a tester acting in place of the role. 

\subsubsection{Authentication and Access Control}

This section includes tests related to the authentication of users and the enforcement of role-based access control. These tests cover requirements related to login functionality and role-specific permissions as outlined in the SRS data model. This section coveres SRS Req \#1

\paragraph{Login with Invalid Credentials}

\begin{enumerate}
\item{FR-1\\}
Control: Manual

Initial State: System at login screen, ready to accept credentials.

Input: Invalid \texttt{UserID} and a combination of valid \texttt{UserID} + Invalid \texttt{Password} for commissioner, captain, and player accounts.

Output: Unsuccessful login. The system is ready to accept new credentials.

Test Case Derivation: Invalid login credentials should result in an unsuccessful login and the user should be able to try again.

How Test Will Be Performed: Tester will attempt to log in with an invalid \texttt{UserID} and \texttt{Password}. Verify that all invalid logins are unsuccessful.

Requirements Covered: SRS Req \#1 (authentication).
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Login with Valid Credentials}

\begin{enumerate}

\item{FR-2\\}
Control: Manual

Initial State: System at login screen, ready to accept credentials.

Input: \texttt{UserID} and \texttt{Password} for valid commissioner, captain, and player accounts.

Output: Successful login for valid credentials.

Test Case Derivation: Valid login credentials should result in a successful login to the system. This is also how the system will differentiate users to perform actions requiring Role permissions.

How Test Will Be Performed: Tester will log in with a valid \texttt{UserID} and Password for each \texttt{Role} (Player, Captain, Commissioner) and verify access to the platform after successful login under the correct account.

Requirements Covered: SRS Req \#1 (authentication).
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Team Management}

This section includes tests for the functionality of team creation and management. These tests verify that captains can create teams with unique names, manage join requests, and prevent duplication errors. This section also includes tests for the functionality allowing players to browse and request to join teams. These tests confirm that players can request to join a team and that requests are accurately reflected to captains. This section covers SRS Req \#5 and \#6.

\paragraph{Captain Registering a Team}

\begin{enumerate}

\item{FR-3\\}
Control: Manual

Initial State: User is logged in with Role set to Captain, with no existing team associated with \texttt{CaptainID}. System is on the create team page, with at least one team registered in the database.

Input: Enter a \texttt{TeamName} that already exists in the database and a Division.

Output: Unsuccessful creation of a team with a duplicate \texttt{TeamName}. Error message displayed to Captain addressing that the \texttt{TeamName} already exists.

Test Case Derivation: As a general rule, there are to be no duplicate \texttt{TeamName}. Captains should not be able to create a team with a \texttt{TeamName} that is already taken

How Test Will Be Performed: Tester (with Captain account) submits a request to create a new team using a duplicate \texttt{TeamName}. Verify that the team is not added to the database.

Requirements Covered: SRS Req \#5 (team creation).

\item{FR-4\\}
Control: Manual

Initial State: User is logged in with Role set to Captain, with no existing team associated with \texttt{CaptainID}. System is on the create team page.

Input: Enter a unique TeamName and Division.

Output: Successful team creation after submission.

Test Case Derivation: With valid input, Captains should be able to register their team into the system.

How Test Will Be Performed: Captain creates a valid new team. Verify that the team is created and added to the database. New entry should include \texttt{TeamID, TeamName, Division, CaptainID, Roster}.

Requirements Covered: SRS Req \#5 (team creation).

\item{FR-5\\}
Control: Manual

Initial State: User logged in with Role set to Captain, with an existing team associated with \texttt{CaptainID}. System is on the create team page.

Input: Enter a new TeamName and Division.

Output: Unsuccessful creation of a team. Error message displayed for multiple teams under one \texttt{CaptainID}.

Test Case Derivation: As a general rule, Captains only have one team. Captains should not be able to create a new team when they already have one registered under their \texttt{CaptainID}.

How Test Will Be Performed: Captain attempts to create a second team. Verify that the team is not entered in the database.

Requirements Covered: SRS Req \#5 (team creation).
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Joining a Team}

\begin{enumerate}

\item{FR-6\\}
Control: Manual

Initial State: User logged in with Role set to Player, without an existing team associated with \texttt{PlayerID}. Another user logged in as Captain of \texttt{TeamName}.

Input: Player requests to join \texttt{TeamName}.

Output: Player's request is sent to the team's Captain.

Test Case Derivation: Players should be able to send join requests to Captains for review and approval.

How Test Will Be Performed: Player requests to join a team. Verify that the associated Captain recieves the request (Refer to \textbf{FR-7}).

Requirements Covered: SRS Req \#6 (joining teams).

\item{FR-7\\}
Control: Manual

Initial State: User logged in with Role set to Captain, with an existing team associated with \texttt{CaptainID}. A player has requested to join the associated team.

Input: Captain receives and approves request.

Output: \texttt{PlayerID} is added to \texttt{Roster} of the team associated with \texttt{TeamName}.

Test Case Derivation: Players should be added to a team after a request is approved.

How Test Will Be Performed: Captain approves a pending player's join request. Verify the team updates accordingly: \texttt{Roster} updated in database and the player should have permissions to view team-specific information.

Requirements Covered: SRS Req \#6 (joining teams).

\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Game Scheduling and Reporting}

This section tests game scheduling and rescheduling requests, focusing on the interaction between captains and commissioners for adjusting game schedules as defined in SRS Req \#7, \#8, \#11, and \#12.

\paragraph{Automated Season Schedule}

\begin{enumerate}

\item{FR-7\\}
Control: Manual

Initial State: Teams have been registered in the system, each with \texttt{TeamIDs} and preferences for game days/times. No current season schedule exists.

Input: 
Set up a sample database file containing:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Team Availability: Preferences for game days and times.
  \item Division Assignments: Each \texttt{TeamID} is assigned a division.
  \item Game Count Requirement: Ensures each team has an equal number of games.
  \item Available Slots: The availability of the event space.
\end{itemize}

Output: The system generates an appropriate season game schedule.

Test Case Derivation: The system needs to be able to generate an initial schedule for the season based on team availability and preferences.

How Test Will Be Performed: Load the database with team availability and divisional information. Run the schedule generation process. Refer to \textbf{TPERF-2} for performance test of the generated schedule.

Requirements Covered: SRS Req \#7 (Schedule Automation).

\end{enumerate}

Input: Captain submits game results (\texttt{Results, ScoreTeamA, ScoreTeamB}) or forfeits for a selected game.

Output: Game report is updated and Standings are updated (\texttt{TeamID, Wins, Losses, Ties, Rank}).

Test Case Derivation: Captains should be able to report game results which should be reflected in the platform's standings/reporting.

How Test Will Be Performed: Captain reports games. Verify that the report is reflected in database and that standings are automatically updated accordingly.

Requirements Covered: SRS Req \#12 (Reporting).

\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Rescheduling}

\begin{enumerate}

\item{FR-9\\}
Control: Manual

Initial State: Season schedule is generated and displayed, with commissioner and captain logged in. System is on scheduling page.

Input: Captain submits a reschedule request in an open slot. The request is valid and associated with the appropriate \texttt{ScheduleID, GameID, and SlotNumber}.

Output: Request is sent to Commissioner.

Test Case Derivation: Rescheduling requests from captains should be sent to the Comissioner for review and approval.

How Test Will Be Performed: Captain initiates reschedule request. Verify that the request is sent to the commissioner for approval.

Requirements Covered: SRS Req \#8 (rescheduling).

\item{FR-10\\}
Control: Manual

Initial State: Commissioner logged in. System is on schedule page with a scheduled game entry available.

Input: Commissioner applies an override (cancel or reschedule) on an existing \texttt{GameID} or approves a reschedule request.

Output: Override is reflected in the schedule. Notifications are sent to all IDs in \texttt{Roster} of teams associated with the overridden game.

Test Case Derivation: Schedule changes should be reflected in all affected user’s view and they should be notified of the changes.

How Test Will Be Performed: Commissioner applies an override on an existing game. Verify the game change (\texttt{Schedule view, SlotNumber}, and \texttt{Available Slots} are updated). Verify notifications are received by both teams.

Requirements Covered: SRS Req \#11 (game overrides).

\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Announcements}

Requirements Covered: SRS Req \#9, \#10 (announcements).
\end{enumerate}

...

\subsection{Tests for Nonfunctional Requirements}

\wss{The nonfunctional requirements for accuracy will likely just reference the
  appropriate functional tests from above.  The test cases should mention
  reporting the relative error for these tests.  Not all projects will
  necessarily have nonfunctional requirements related to accuracy.}

\wss{For some nonfunctional tests, you won't be setting a target threshold for
passing the test, but rather describing the experiment you will do to measure
the quality for different inputs.  For instance, you could measure speed versus
the problem size.  The output of the test isn't pass/fail, but rather a summary
table or graph.}

\wss{Tests related to usability could include conducting a usability test and
  survey.  The survey will be in the Appendix.}

\wss{Static tests, review, inspections, and walkthroughs, will not follow the
format for the tests given below.}

\wss{If you introduce static tests in your plan, you need to provide details.
How will they be done?  In cases like code (or document) walkthroughs, who will
be involved? Be specific.}

\subsection{Traceability Between Test Cases and Requirements}

\wss{Provide a table that shows which test cases are supporting which
  requirements.}

\section{Unit Test Description}

\wss{This section should not be filled in until after the MIS (detailed design
  document) has been completed.}

\wss{Reference your MIS (detailed design document) and explain your overall
philosophy for test case selection.}  

\wss{To save space and time, it may be an option to provide less detail in this section.  
For the unit tests you can potentially layout your testing strategy here.  That is, you 
can explain how tests will be selected for each module.  For instance, your test building 
approach could be test cases for each access program, including one test for normal behaviour 
and as many tests as needed for edge cases.  Rather than create the details of the input 
and output here, you could point to the unit testing code.  For this to work, you code 
needs to be well-documented, with meaningful names for all of the tests.}

\subsection{Unit Testing Scope}

\wss{What modules are outside of the scope.  If there are modules that are
  developed by someone else, then you would say here if you aren't planning on
  verifying them.  There may also be modules that are part of your software, but
  have a lower priority for verification than others.  If this is the case,
  explain your rationale for the ranking of module importance.}

\subsection{Tests for Functional Requirements}

\wss{Most of the verification will be through automated unit testing.  If
  appropriate specific modules can be verified by a non-testing based
  technique.  That can also be documented in this section.}

\subsubsection{Module 1}

\wss{Include a blurb here to explain why the subsections below cover the module.
  References to the MIS would be good.  You will want tests from a black box
  perspective and from a white box perspective.  Explain to the reader how the
  tests were selected.}

\subsection{Tests for Nonfunctional Requirements}

\wss{If there is a module that needs to be independently assessed for
  performance, those test cases can go here.  In some projects, planning for
  nonfunctional tests of units will not be that relevant.}

\wss{These tests may involve collecting performance data from previously
  mentioned functional tests.}
