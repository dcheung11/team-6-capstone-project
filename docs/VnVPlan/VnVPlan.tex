\wss{The intention of the VnV plan is to increase confidence in the software.
However, this does not mean listing every verification and validation technique
that has ever been devised.  The VnV plan should also be a \textbf{feasible}
plan. Execution of the plan should be possible with the time and team available.
If the full plan cannot be completed during the time available, it can either be
modified to ``fake it'', or a better solution is to add a section describing
what work has been completed and what work is still planned for the future.}

\wss{The VnV plan is typically started after the requirements stage, but before
the design stage.  This means that the sections related to unit testing cannot
initially be completed.  The sections will be filled in after the design stage
is complete.  the final version of the VnV plan should have all sections filled
in.}

\section{General Information}

\subsection{Summary}

The software being tested is the McMaster GSA Softball League Management Platform. This platform is designed to support and streamline operations for the McMaster GSA softball league. Key features include team management, game scheduling, reporting functionalities, and communication tools. The platform aims to simplify tasks for league administrators, captains, and players by providing a centralized system for managing league information, tracking standings, scheduling games, and maintaining up-to-date team rosters.

\subsection{Objectives}

\subsubsection*{Primary}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Build confidence in software correctness}: Ensure that core functionalities, including team management, game scheduling, and result reporting, operate as expected.
    \item \textbf{Demonstrate adequate usability}: Confirm that the system interface is intuitive and accessible for users with varied technical backgrounds, such as league commissioners, captains, and players.
    \item \textbf{Verify data integrity}: Ensure accurate and consistent data across all features, from player rosters to game results and standings.
    \item \textbf{Assess security}: Validate that user access levels and authentication are correctly implemented to secure sensitive data.
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection*{Out of Scope}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Accessibility Testing}: Accessibility checks, such as screen reader compatibility, keyboard-only navigation, and compliance with accessibility standards (e.g., WCAG), will not be covered in this scope. This decision is made because the platformâ€™s primary user base does not require stringent accessibility support, and our focus is primarily on basic usability rather than comprehensive accessibility.
    
    \item \textbf{Performance and Load Testing}: Extensive load and stress testing to measure system performance under high user traffic will be omitted. Given the platform's limited expected user base and the controlled environment in which it will operate, performance considerations are minimal. Our team will assume that system responsiveness and speed are sufficient for a small to medium load without simulating peak traffic.
    
    \item \textbf{In-depth Security and Vulnerability Testing}: While security basics, such as user authentication and access control, will be verified, extensive security testing (e.g., penetration testing and vulnerability scanning) is outside our scope. This is due to resource constraints and the relatively low-risk nature of the application, which handles limited sensitive data and is intended for a small group of users within the league.
    
    \item \textbf{External Library and API Validation}: It is assumed that all libraries and APIs have been thoroughly tested by their developers, so they will not undergo additional validation in our testing scope. Our focus will be on integration rather than on validating the correctness of external components themselves.
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Challenge Level and Extras}

The challenge level we have established for this project is General.
The extras we have described for our project include usability testing, user
documentation, and design thinking. We believe these are strongly relevant
to our project since it is a heavily user-centric web application that must in-
corporate many principles of human-computer interfacing. We will track our
changes consistently with written documentation as well as version control (via
Git and GitHub). We will incorporate design thinking when developing and
designing our system and UI, and we will conduct comprehensive usability tests
with existing/potential stakeholders to compile improvements and verify design
decisions.

\subsection{Relevant Documentation}

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Software Requirements Specification (SRS)} \citep{SRS}: The SRS defines the detailed functional and non-functional requirements of the system, providing a clear basis for testing each requirement. By mapping each test case back to the SRS, we can ensure complete coverage of all system specifications. 

  \item \textbf{Hazard Analysis} \citep{Hazard-Analysis}: The Hazard Analysis identifies potential hazards associated with the software system, assessing their impact and likelihood. This document is critical for understanding risk factors that may affect system safety and reliability. By identifying and analyzing hazards early in the development process, we can implement strategies to mitigate risks and ensure that the system operates safely under expected conditions.
 
  \item \textbf{Development Plan Document} \citep{Development-Plan}: The development plan contains architectural decisions and structural design rationale for the system, which are critical for validating design integrity and system stability. This document guides us in identifying key design aspects that need testing to verify adherence to design principles and effective implementation of required functionalities.
 
  \item \textbf{Module Interface Specification (MIS)} (TBD): The MIS defines the interface details for each module, including input and output data formats, parameter types, and function signatures. This document ensures that modules correctly integrate with one another, supporting our VnV plan by allowing us to focus on the correctness of inter-module communication.

  \item \textbf{User Manual (UM)} (TBD): The UM outlines the user interface and operational aspects of the system. It serves as a reference for usability testing, as it details expected user workflows and assists in validating whether the system operates as anticipated from the end-user perspective.
\end{itemize}

\section{Plan}

\subsection{Verification and Validation Team}

V\&V Team Lead: Derek
\begin{itemize}
    \item Oversees the entire verification and validation process and ensures all activities are completed according to the plan.
    \item Coordinates with other members to align V\&V activities with project deadlines.
    \item Reviews and approves test plans, reports, and results.
    \item Researches and ensures that the team has the tools needed for testing.
\end{itemize}

\noindent Developers: Emma, Damien, Temituoyo, Jad
\begin{itemize}
    \item Develop code and conduct unit testing to ensure basic functionality
    \item Address any defects or issues they identified during testing
    \item Participate in code reviews and provide feedback to ensure code implementation is of high quality
    \item Assists in setting up automated testing frameworks
\end{itemize}

\subsection{SRS Verification Plan}

\noindent Our approach for SRS verification involves understanding the following objectives:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Validate that the SRS covers the projectâ€™s functional and non-functional requirements
    \item Verify that requirements are clearly defined, consistent and testable
    \item Validate that requirements are feasible and achievable within project constraints
\end{itemize}

After understanding these objectives, we will prioritize the following steps:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Have a team meeting and brainstorm all use case scenarios and requirements before meeting with our supervisor. We can make a SRS checklist to do this.
    \item Conduct a peer review with another team. For our capstone, another team is also doing the same project, so it will be best to work with them.
    \item Book a meeting with our supervisor and present the following use cases and requirements our platform covers.
    \item Discuss possible use cases and requirements with our supervisor. We can add these new ideas to our SRS checklist.
    
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Design Verification Plan}

Verification Methods:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Code Reviews 
        \\ \\Team members can conduct code reviews regularly to focus on code readability, efficiency, and to ensure that our code meets design requirements and specifications.
    \item Automated Testing

\subsection{Implementation Verification Plan}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Code Walkthroughs
    \\ \\ Developers of a segment of code will share and present it to peers. The main focus here is design principles and coding standards.

    \item Code Inspections
    \\ \\ Peers will inspect code to find possible ways for optimization.

    \item Static Analyzers
    \\ \\ Use linting tools, such as ESLint to detect syntax errors and uphold standard code practices.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Automated Testing and Verification Tools}

\noindent Primary Testing Tool: Playwright\\

\noindent Playwright is the most modern end-to-end testing framework. It can support testing across different browsers like Chrome, Firefox, and Safari. The support that this framework has is ideal for ensuring that our platform works smoothly across various devices and browsers.\\

\noindent Compared to other testing frameworks, Playwright offers faster execution, and built-in capabilities for handling complex UI interactions like pop-ups, a fast and growing online community, and Microsoft, a tech giant, backs it up. \\

\noindent Linting Tool: ESLint\\

\noindent ESLint will be used to catch potential issues in the code, such as syntax errors, security vulnerabilities, or deviations from coding standards, before execution.\\

\noindent Saves time in code reviews and reduces the risk of runtime errors by enforcing best practices during development.

\noindent Continuous Integration Tool: GitHub Actions\\

\noindent GitHub Actions will be used for continuous integration. At the early phases of this project, workflows will be used to automatically generate/compile documentation upon pull request merging. In the future, we may invoke workflows to deploy the web application upon merge to development branch. \\

\noindent Saves time in PDF generation and code reviews and prevents Latex errors from being pushed to main branch. \\

\subsection{Software Validation Plan}

Methods: \\

\begin{itemize}
    \item Requirement-Based Testing
    \\ \\ Create test cases based on requirements to verify that each functionality works as expected.
    
    \item Regression Testing
    \\ \\ Ensure basic functionality remains unaffected when developing new features by running a script that tests all the basic functionalities before updates are pushed.

    \item Device Testing
    \\ \\ Validate that the platform works across various devices, such as smartphones, tablets, desktops, etc.

    \item Cross-browser Testing
    \\ \\ Validate that the platform works across various browsers,
    such as Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc.
    
\end{itemize}

\section{System Tests}

This section goes over the tests for both functional and non-functional requirements of the platform. Functional requirements tests cover core features like authentication, team management, and scheduling. These tests are focused on making sure the system does exactly what itâ€™s supposed to, based on the requirements laid out in the SRS.

The non-functional requirements tests are split into categories to check additional qualities of the system: Look and Feel, Usability and Humanity, Performance, Operational and Environmental, Maintainability and Support, and Security. These tests make sure the platform isnâ€™t just functional but also user-friendly, reliable, compatible across devices, and secure. Each section breaks down the tests and criteria weâ€™ll use to evaluate these areas.

\subsection{Tests for Functional Requirements}

This section is divided into different areas to cover subsets of the functional requirements comprehensively. The following tests cover core features like authentication, team management, and scheduling. References to the SRS are provided to show the alignment with documented requirements.

It should be noted that when \texttt{Roles} are described doing actions in the functional tests (e.g. ``Captain inputs...''), these are assumed a tester acting in place of the role. 

\subsubsection{Authentication and Access Control}

\subsection{Traceability Between Test Cases and Requirements}

Refer to requirements in SRS Document () 

\section{Unit Test Description}

\wss{This section should not be filled in until after the MIS (detailed design
  document) has been completed.}

\wss{Reference your MIS (detailed design document) and explain your overall
philosophy for test case selection.}  

\wss{To save space and time, it may be an option to provide less detail in this section.  
For the unit tests you can potentially layout your testing strategy here.  That is, you 
can explain how tests will be selected for each module.  For instance, your test building 
approach could be test cases for each access program, including one test for normal behaviour 
and as many tests as needed for edge cases.  Rather than create the details of the input 
and output here, you could point to the unit testing code.  For this to work, you code 
needs to be well-documented, with meaningful names for all of the tests.}

\subsection{Unit Testing Scope}

\wss{What modules are outside of the scope.  If there are modules that are
  developed by someone else, then you would say here if you aren't planning on
  verifying them.  There may also be modules that are part of your software, but
  have a lower priority for verification than others.  If this is the case,
  explain your rationale for the ranking of module importance.}

\subsection{Tests for Functional Requirements}

\wss{Most of the verification will be through automated unit testing.  If
  appropriate specific modules can be verified by a non-testing based
  technique.  That can also be documented in this section.}

\subsubsection{Module 1}

\wss{Include a blurb here to explain why the subsections below cover the module.
  References to the MIS would be good.  You will want tests from a black box
  perspective and from a white box perspective.  Explain to the reader how the
  tests were selected.}

\subsection{Tests for Nonfunctional Requirements}

\wss{If there is a module that needs to be independently assessed for
  performance, those test cases can go here.  In some projects, planning for
  nonfunctional tests of units will not be that relevant.}

\wss{These tests may involve collecting performance data from previously
  mentioned functional tests.}
