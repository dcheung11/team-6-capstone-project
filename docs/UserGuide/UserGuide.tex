This guide covers key actions such as viewing schedules, checking game results, and updating player profiles. Whether you're a new player or a returning member, this document will help you navigate the platform with ease

\section{Getting Started: Signing Up}

        \item \textbf{Last Name}

        \item \textbf{Password}
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Log In} – Return to the login page, enter your email and password, and access your account.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Overview of Features and Functionality}

The platform is designed to provide users with an intuitive, self-service experience, allowing players and commissioners to manage their activities seamlessly. With a user-friendly interface, players can easily register, manage, and modify their teams, while commissioners can efficiently oversee and manage the entire season. Below are the key features and functionalities of the platform.

\subsection{User Features}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Create and Manage Teams:} Players can easily create their own teams by registering through the home page. The registering player automatically becomes the captain of the team. This allows captains to invite new members and coordinate games using the rescheduling system.
    \item \textbf{Join a Team:} Players wishing to join a team must be invited by a team captain. Captains can browse through the list of players and send out invitations to join their team. Once the player accepts the invitation, they will be added to the team’s roster. This ensures that only players personally invited by the captain can join a team, keeping the process streamlined and controlled.
    \item \textbf{Leave a Team:} Players can leave a team at any time through the team management page. If a player decides to leave, they can rejoin another team through invitation. The platform ensures that leaving a team does not affect other players or the team’s standing.
    \item \textbf{View Team and Season Progress:} Players have access to view their team’s progress, upcoming match schedules, and results. Additionally, they can keep track of the overall season standings, which helps players stay informed and motivated throughout the competition.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Commissioner Features}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Manage Seasons:} Commissioners have full control over season management. They can open, launch, and archive seasons, manage registered teams and their preferences, and set important deadlines for team registration. These functionalities ensure each season runs smoothly and on schedule.
    \item \textbf{Approve/Reject Team Registrations:} Commissioners can review team registrations to ensure compliance with platform rules and waiver consent. Commissioners can approve teams at their discretion based on whether the team has paid their cash fee and overall eligibility. Commissioners can move teams between divisions if needed, which helps maintain a fair and competitive environment.
    \item \textbf{Create and Manage Announcements:} Commissioners can easily create, update, and remove announcements to keep teams and players informed. Whether it’s deadline reminders, rule updates, or general season info, announcements ensure everyone stays in the loop.
    \item \textbf{Intuitive, Easy-to-Use Interface:} The platform is designed for efficiency and ease of use. An intuitive dashboard gives commissioners quick access to team management, registration data, progress tracking, and announcements in just a few clicks.
\end{itemize}

\noindent Overall, the platform empowers players to manage their teams and join or leave as needed, while giving commissioners all the tools required to efficiently manage the season. The ease of use for both players and commissioners ensures that everyone can focus on enjoying the season and the competition, without the platform getting in the way.
