\section{Purpose of the Project}
\subsection{User Business}
The primary business of the McMaster GSA softball league is to facilitate recreational softball activities for students, staff, and alumni. The league aims to provide an organized platform for scheduling games, managing teams, and tracking player performance, enhancing the overall experience for participants. By streamlining league operations, the platform will foster a more inclusive and efficient environment, enabling better communication among players, captains, and commissioners.\
\begin{itemize}
  \item Team Management: captains will have the ability to create and manage their teams, inviting players to join, assigning roles, and ensuring that all team members are informed about practices and games.
  \item Game Scheduling: users will utilize the scheduling tools to view upcoming games, propose new times, and request rescheduling, ensuring that all participants are aware of their commitments and can manage their time effectively.
  \item Communication and Announcements: Commissioners will post league-wide announcements and updates, allowing all users to stay informed about important news, such as changes in scheduling, league policies, or events.
  \item Performance Tracking: players can track their individual and team performance through leaderboards and standings, fostering a sense of competition and motivation to improve.
  \item Payment Management: the application will provide visibility into players' payment statuses, enabling captains and commissioners to easily monitor team compliance with league participation requirements.
  \item Community Building: through features such as announcements and event notifications, users can engage with one another beyond the field, strengthening community ties and enhancing the overall experience of league participation.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Goals of the Project}
The primary goal of the McMaster GSA softball league platform project is to develop an intuitive, user-friendly web application that enhances the management and operation of the league. Specific goals include:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Streamlined Scheduling and Communication: Simplify the scheduling process for games and practices, allowing captains to manage their teams effectively while facilitating clear communication between all stakeholders.
  \item Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): Implement a secure login system using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) that allows different levels of access for commissioners, captains, and players, ensuring that users can perform actions relevant to their roles without compromising sensitive information.
  \item Improved User Interface: Design a modern, responsive user interface that enhances usability and engagement, making it easier for participants to navigate the platform and access essential features.
  \item Enhanced Data Management: Develop robust features for managing player registrations, tracking payment statuses, and maintaining accurate standings and leaderboards, thereby reducing administrative overhead and increasing transparency.
  \item Facilitate Community Engagement: Foster a sense of community among participants through features such as announcements, event notifications, and an organized platform for sharing updates, enhancing the overall experience of league participation.
\end{itemize}

The GSA will benefit from increased participation and smoother operations, ultimately fostering a stronger community at McMaster.
\subsection{Customer}
The customers are the users of the platform, including players, captains, and commissioners. They seek an intuitive and efficient system that allows for easy management of games, team coordination, and communication. By addressing their needs, the platform aims to increase user satisfaction and engagement within the league.
\subsection{Other Stakeholders}
Other stakeholders include the university administration, potential sponsors, and the broader McMaster University community. These groups may have a vested interest in the successful operation of the league, as it contributes to student life and community engagement. Sponsors may seek visibility and promotional opportunities through the league's activities.
\subsection{Hands-On Users of the Project}
Hands-on users include the players, captains, and commissioners who will interact with the platform daily. Players will use the system to join teams, view schedules, and track their performance. Captains will manage their teams, schedule games, and communicate with players. Commissioners will oversee league operations, post announcements, and manage administrative tasks.
\subsection{Personas}
Player Persona: A student looking to join a team, participate in recreational activities/games, check their game schedule, and track their performance.
Captain Persona: An organized individual responsible for managing team logistics, rescheduling games, and ensuring effective communication.
Commissioner Persona: A knowledgeable overseer who ensures the league operates smoothly, creates game schedules, handles disputes, and communicates important updates to all users.
\subsection{Priorities Assigned to Users}
Players prioritize ease of joining teams, checking their game schedule, and tracking performance.
Captains focus on scheduling flexibility, team management features, and communication tools.
Commissioners prioritize administrative functionality, announcement features, and overall system reliability.
\subsection{User Participation}
User participation will be critical throughout the project. Stakeholders will provide feedback during the development process to ensure the platform meets their needs. User testing sessions will be conducted to gather insights and refine the interface and features.

\section*{Appendix --- Reflection}

The information in this section will be used to evaluate the team members on the
graduate attribute of Lifelong Learning.  Please answer the following questions:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item What knowledge and skills will the team collectively need to acquire to
  successfully complete this capstone project?  Examples of possible knowledge
  to acquire include domain specific knowledge from the domain of your
  application, or software engineering knowledge, mechatronics knowledge or
  computer science knowledge.  Skills may be related to technology, or writing,
  or presentation, or team management, etc.  You should look to identify at
  least one item for each team member.
  \item For each of the knowledge areas and skills identified in the previous
  question, what are at least two approaches to acquiring the knowledge or
  mastering the skill?  Of the identified approaches, which will each team
  member pursue, and why did they make this choice?
\end{enumerate}
