\section{Migration to the New Product}
\subsection{Requirements for Migration to the New Product}
To migrate from the existing platform to our redesign involves several key steps to ensure that the transfer of all relevant data, features, and functionalities is seamless and complete:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Data Preservation}: All current data from the existing platform must be preserved and migrated to the new platform. The specific data to be transferred will be confirmed through consultation with the current platform administrator, ensuring that only the necessary and relevant data is included in the migration.
    \item \textbf{Feature Continuity}: Ensure that all features present in the original platform are retained in the redesigned version, with enhancements and improvements where applicable.
    \item \textbf{Minimizing Downtime}: The softball season begins in April, which falls around when the project is expected to be completed. Due to this tight deadline, the migration process should be planned to minimize downtime for users, ensuring that the transition is as smooth as possible with minimal impact on league operations.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Data That Has to be Modified or Translated for the New System}
During the migration process, specific data elements may need to be modified or translated to align with the new platform's structure and data requirements:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{User Accounts and Roles}: The login system needs a complete redesign. User account information, including usernames, passwords, and roles (commissioner, captain, player), will need to be reformatted to match the requirements of the new authentication system.
    \item \textbf{Team and Match Data}: Team rosters, match schedules, and historical results may require adjustments to fit the new database schema. This may involve reformatting data fields or translating old data structures to new formats.
\end{itemize}

\section{Costs}
The capstone supervisor expressed minimizing costs. Our approach will be done with free frameworks, such as React.js, and affordable hosting plans such as AWS or Google Cloud. Our team will emphasize core functionality, and avoid creating unnecessary features and costs that could undermine the product goal. By following these cost-conscious strategies, the project can stay within budget while delivering a functional and scalable platform.

\section{User Documentation and Training}
\subsection{User Documentation Requirements}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Comprehensive User Guide}: Create a detailed user manual page tab that outlines:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Getting Started}: Instructions on how to register, create teams, and navigate the platform before delving deep into more advanced features.
        \item \textbf{Feature Descriptions}: Written and visual explanations of each feature, such as team management, scheduling, score tracking, etc.
        \item \textbf{FAQs}: Address common questions and troubleshooting tips to help users resolve issues independently. If unresolved, prompt users to email for more support or direct them to the discussions page.
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Interactive Tutorials}: Create pop-up icons that demonstrate key functionalities, making it easier for both new and existing users to understand how to use the platform effectively.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Training Requirements}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Help Support Desk}: A dedicated support email or live chat feature where users can ask questions or report issues with someone real.
    \item \textbf{Feedback Section}: Implement a section where users can provide feedback through open-ended surveys to help improve the platform.
    \item \textbf{Discussion}: A section where users can publicly post their questions and other users are free to answer them.
\end{itemize}

\section{Waiting Room}
For the softball league platform, the “waiting room” will most likely be the feature for players who have registered, but do not have a pre-formed team. These players are called “free agents,” who may be added to teams later once all team rosters are confirmed. This concept is similar to how IMLeague is handled, which is the McMaster Intramural League platform. For example, a student desires to play softball and registers for the platform. As pre-formed teams are registered and confirmed, this student will be assigned to one of the teams that have extra space on their roster. Hence, they are “waiting” for a team to join.

\section{Ideas for Solution}
Players who sign up without a pre-formed team will be placed in a waiting room, designating them as “free agents.” This waiting room is a holding area until all team rosters are confirmed. Other teams can choose from this holding area if they need any players before the final roster confirmation date. However, all players will eventually be auto-assigned to a team if the waiting room is still non-empty. Players from the waiting room will be notified of status updates. Players who register late will also be automatically assigned from the waiting room.

Therefore, we need a database to hold the status of each player in the waiting room. On the front user interface, the waiting room should be displayed to all users, so teams can see available free agents. For users with team manager permissions, they will be able to invite free agents from the waiting room to their teams if desired.

\section*{Appendix --- Reflection}

The information in this section will be used to evaluate the team members on the
graduate attribute of Lifelong Learning.  Please answer the following questions:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item What knowledge and skills will the team collectively need to acquire to
  successfully complete this capstone project?  Examples of possible knowledge
  to acquire include domain specific knowledge from the domain of your
  application, or software engineering knowledge, mechatronics knowledge or
  computer science knowledge.  Skills may be related to technology, or writing,
  or presentation, or team management, etc.  You should look to identify at
  least one item for each team member.
  \item For each of the knowledge areas and skills identified in the previous
  question, what are at least two approaches to acquiring the knowledge or
  mastering the skill?  Of the identified approaches, which will each team
  member pursue, and why did they make this choice?
\end{enumerate}
