\section{The Scope of the Work}
\subsection{The Current Situation}
The current implementation of the GSA softball league platform is run on outdated software.
This issue makes the management of the league platform difficult without a certain degree of
programming knowledge. The purpose of the GSA softball platform is to manage the softball
league functionalities (communication, scheduling, player logins, etc.) so it meets the needs
and demands of the league.
\subsection{The Context of the Work}
The GSA Softball League Platform interacts with various external entities including players, captains, commissioners, and integrated systems. The system context diagram below illustrates these interaction boundaries, data flows, and system interfaces, highlighting the scope of the platform's functionality and its relationships with users and external systems.

\end{center}

\subsection{Specifying a Business Use Case}
The primary business use case for this platform is to efficiently manage all aspects of league operations from player registrations to game scheduling in a user-friendly and streamlined manner. The platform will provide commissioners, team captains, and players with a centralized system to interact with the league. The system allows commissioners to oversee the entire league, manage team and player information, and handle payments. Team captains will be able to manage their rosters, submit rescheduling requests, and report game scores, while players can join teams, view schedules, and observe league rankings and scores.
For example, team captains can log in to the platform and create their teams. Players can join a team by requesting approval from the captain, while commissioners can monitor the overall progress and approve team formations. Throughout the season, captains can report game scores directly into the system, which automatically updates the standings. If a team needs to reschedule a game, the captain can request a change through the system, selecting from available timeslots. The system will queue the request for commissioner approval and update the schedule once the rescheduling is confirmed.

\end{itemize}

\section{Off-the-Shelf Solutions}
This section details the off-the-shelf solutions that will be used in the project.
\subsection{Ready-Made Products}
There are no ready-made products that will be a part of our solution. The objective is to update and completely redesign the current softball league web-based platform. While features from the original platform will be transferred over to maintain continuity, the entire solution will be developed in-house based on updated requirements and best practices.

\subsection{Reusable Components}
While no third-party reusable components will be integrated, several features from the original platform, such as user authentication, team management, and scheduling, will be carried over to ensure continuity. These components will be updated and enhanced as part of the complete redesign to meet the new requirements.

\subsection{Products That Can Be Copied}
There are no external products that will be directly copied for this project. However, the redesign will reference the design and functional elements of the current website to maintain familiarity for existing users. Additionally, best practices from similar platforms will be researched and adapted to improve the user experience.


\section{New Problems}
This section details the new problems that may arise during the project.
\subsection{Effects on the Current Environment}
Implementing the new system will require a complete overhaul of the existing McMaster GSA softball league platform, which may cause temporary disruption to ongoing league activities. The outdated system will be replaced, and users accustomed to the old methods may face a learning curve during the transition. Additionally, migrating any existing data (such as player information, schedules, and standings) to the new platform will need to be handled carefully to avoid loss or corruption. However, the improved system will provide long-term benefits by reducing maintenance and manual input required by the commissioners and administrators. 
\subsection{Effects on the Installed Systems}
Since the current system is outdated integrating the new platform may require adjustments to the existing server infrastructure or cloud services. The new system will be built on modern technologies which may require updating the server environment to ensure compatibility with these technologies. If hosted on legacy systems, a migration to a cloud or updated hosting service might be required.
\subsection{Potential User Problems}
Users (commissioners, captains, players) who are familiar with the current platform may struggle with adapting to the new interface and features. Particularly, older users or users with less technical proficiency may have difficulty navigating the system or understanding new functionalities like the rescheduling workflow, leaderboard tracking, or player management. Proper documentation and user training will be necessary to ensure a smooth transition and reduce user frustration. Moreover, captains and commissioners may need additional guidance on using automated features like team creation, player approvals, and schedule rescheduling.
\subsection{Limitations in the Anticipated Implementation Environment That May
Inhibit the New Product}
The project must be compatible with various devices (desktop, tablet, mobile), which presents challenges in ensuring consistent performance and user experience across different screen sizes and browsers. Another potential limitation is the anticipated usage spikes, such as the heavy volume of rescheduling requests at the beginning of the season, which could strain the system. The hosting environment needs to handle potential scalability issues, and the system should be optimized for responsiveness during high-demand periods. There may also be limitations in integrating certain external services, such as payment verification systems, if APIs or infrastructure constraints arise.
\subsection{Follow-Up Problems}
After the initial launch of the new platform, follow-up issues may include bug fixes, additional feature requests, and ongoing user feedback that necessitates adjustments. Since the system will rely on certain automated processes (e.g., scheduling, score reporting), there may be edge cases or scenarios not accounted for during development, which would require post-launch refinements. Maintenance and updates to the platform will need to be addressed continuously to ensure smooth functionality, especially in response to league changes or growing participation numbers. Moreover, as the system expands, additional support or enhancements might be required to maintain security and efficiency.

\section{Tasks}
This section details the tasks that will be undertaken during the project.

\subsection{Project Planning}
The platform's development will follow a structured plan prioritizing the requirements as outlined in the SRS. The functional requirements have been grouped based on priority, with each group indicating the relevant requirement numbers.

\section{Migration to the New Product}
This section details the requirements for migrating to the new product.
\subsection{Requirements for Migration to the New Product}
To migrate from the existing platform to our redesign involves several key steps to ensure that the transfer of all relevant data, features, and functionalities is seamless and complete:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Data Preservation}: All current data from the existing platform must be preserved and migrated to the new platform. The specific data to be transferred will be confirmed through consultation with the current platform administrator, ensuring that only the necessary and relevant data is included in the migration.
    \item \textbf{Feature Continuity}: Ensure that all features present in the original platform are retained in the redesigned version, with enhancements and improvements where applicable.
    \item \textbf{Minimizing Downtime}: The softball season begins in April, which falls around when the project is expected to be completed. Due to this tight deadline, the migration process should be planned to minimize downtime for users, ensuring that the transition is as smooth as possible with minimal impact on league operations.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Data That Has to be Modified or Translated for the New System}
During the migration process, specific data elements may need to be modified or translated to align with the new platform's structure and data requirements:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{User Accounts and Roles}: The login system needs a complete redesign. User account information, including usernames, passwords, and roles (commissioner, captain, player), will need to be reformatted to match the requirements of the new authentication system.
    \item \textbf{Team and Match Data}: Team rosters, match schedules, and historical results may require adjustments to fit the new database schema. This may involve reformatting data fields or translating old data structures to new formats.
\end{itemize}

\section{Costs}
The capstone supervisor expressed minimizing costs. Our approach will be done with free frameworks, such as React.js, and affordable hosting plans such as AWS or Google Cloud. Our team will emphasize core functionality, and avoid creating unnecessary features and costs that could undermine the product goal. By following these cost-conscious strategies, the project can stay within budget while delivering a functional and scalable platform.

\section{User Documentation and Training}
This section details the user documentation and training requirements.
\subsection{User Documentation Requirements}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Comprehensive User Guide}: Create a detailed user manual page tab that outlines:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Getting Started}: Instructions on how to register, create teams, and navigate the platform before delving deep into more advanced features.
        \item \textbf{Feature Descriptions}: Written and visual explanations of each feature, such as team management, scheduling, score tracking, etc.
        \item \textbf{FAQs}: Address common questions and troubleshooting tips to help users resolve issues independently. If unresolved, prompt users to email for more support or direct them to the discussions page.
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Interactive Tutorials}: Create pop-up icons that demonstrate key functionalities, making it easier for both new and existing users to understand how to use the platform effectively.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Training Requirements}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Help Support Desk}: A dedicated support email or live chat feature where users can ask questions or report issues with someone real.
    \item \textbf{Feedback Section}: Implement a section where users can provide feedback through open-ended surveys to help improve the platform.
    \item \textbf{Discussion}: A section where users can publicly post their questions and other users are free to answer them.
\end{itemize}

\section{Waiting Room}
For the softball league platform, the "waiting room" will most likely be the feature for players who have registered, but do not have a pre-formed team. These players are called "free agents," who may be added to teams later once all team rosters are confirmed. This concept is similar to how IMLeague is handled, which is the McMaster Intramural League platform. For example, a student desires to play softball and registers for the platform. As pre-formed teams are registered and confirmed, this student will be assigned to one of the teams that have extra space on their roster. Hence, they are "waiting" for a team to join.

\section{Ideas for Solution}
Players who sign up without a pre-formed team will be placed in a waiting room, designating them as "free agents." This waiting room is a holding area until all team rosters are confirmed. Other teams can choose from this holding area if they need any players before the final roster confirmation date. However, all players will eventually be auto-assigned to a team if the waiting room is still non-empty. Players from the waiting room will be notified of status updates. Players who register late will also be automatically assigned from the waiting room.

Therefore, we need a database to hold the status of each player in the waiting room. On the front user interface, the waiting room should be displayed to all users, so teams can see available free agents. For users with team manager permissions, they will be able to invite free agents from the waiting room to their teams if desired.
