    \end{itemize}

\section{Unit Testing}

\subsection{Current Backend Unit Testing}

Our current backend unit testing aligns closely with our VnV Plan for unit testing. We opted to start by unit testing the backend models in order to ensure that the foundational components of our platform are reliable and follow our requirements so that we can build more complex features with confidence.

Some tests were added since the VnVPlan was created and some tests were removed and are to be tested in integration testing.

Our backend unit testing is conducted using Jest and executed via npm test in the backend directory. The test files are located in the backend/test folder. These unit tests focus on verifying the fundamental functionality of our backend models, ensuring they behave as expected when interacting with MongoDB.

We began with backend testing because any issues caused by front-end components would be reflected in the backend models. By starting with the backend, we can ensure that the core functionality of our platform is reliable and that we can build more complex features with confidence.

Tests for Season, Reschedule Request, Announcements are WIP and some of their tests are documented below, but were not part of the VnVPlan.

\end{enumerate}

\section{Changes Due to Testing}



During testing, some test cases were scrapped due to changes in the platform's implementation. Initially, we had the following test case for player team requests:\\

   \textbf{FR-6}  
      \begin{itemize}
          \item Description: Player requesting to join a team.
          \item How Test Will Be Performed: Tester will attempt to join a team while logged in as a Player without an existing team. Verify that the associated Captain receives the request (Refer to FR-7).
          \item Requirements Covered: SRS Req \#6 (joining teams).
          \item Inputs: Player requests to join \texttt{TeamName}.
          \item Expected Output: Player’s request is sent to the team’s Captain.
          \item Actual Output: Not Tested Yet.
          \item Result: Not Tested Yet.
      \end{itemize}

However, after further meetings with our supervisor, we revised the implementation to allow only team captains to invite players. As a result, the functionality to request joining a team was removed to prevent spamming of join requests, and this test case was no longer valid. \\


While performing other test cases, we identified improvements that prompted changes to the platform and test cases. For example, the following test case was modified:\\

 \textbf{FR-8}  
      \begin{itemize}
          \item Description: Captains submitting game results, which update the standings.
          \item How Test Will Be Performed: Captain submits game result and game scores (Win/Lose/Tie, ScoreTeamA, ScoreTeamB). Verify that the report is reflected in the database and that standings update accordingly.
          \item Requirements Covered: SRS Req \#12 (Reporting).
          \item Inputs:  
              \begin{itemize} 
                  \item ScoreTeamA: Score for Team A.  
                  \item ScoreTeamB: Score for Team B.  
              \end{itemize}
          \item Expected Output: Game report is updated, and standings reflect the new results.
          \item Actual Output: Game report successfully updates, and standings are correctly modified.
          \item Result: Pass
      \end{itemize}

Upon review, we decided to simplify the process by removing the need for captains to manually submit the result (Win/Lose/Tie). Instead, we implemented backend logic to automatically calculate the game result based on the scores, enhancing the user experience.

\section{Automated Testing}

Our automated testing is conducted using Jest and React Testing Library for the frontend and Jest for the backend. 
We have not yet set up CI for our automated testing, but we plan to do so in the near future.
Our unit tests and system tests are scripts to be run run locally using the command \texttt{npm test} in the respective directories.
More details are found in the Unit Testing section above and the FR Evaluation section.

\section{Code Coverage Metrics}

\subsection{Method}

The test coverage was generated using Jest, ensuring thorough validation of our codebase.

\subsection{Analysis}
The results indicate a good overall coverage, garnering great confidence in our foundational models.
Some errors are causing the controllers to have some bugs when detecting coverage, and we are working on extending and fixing our system tests. We made up for the lower coverage by extensively manually testing the controllers and ensuring they work as expected.

\subsection{Next Steps}
As we continue to improve our controller tests, we will focus on writing more integration tests to ensure complete coverage. For now, we are confident in the overall stability of the system, thanks to the solid foundation provided by our model and acceptance tests.

\section*{Appendix --- Reflection}

The information in this section will be used to evaluate the team members on the
graduate attribute of Reflection.

\input{../Reflection.tex}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item What went well while writing this deliverable?
  
  The process of gathering and documenting test cases went smoothly, particularly due to the VnV Plan that we created previously to look back onto and the effective communication with the team. The detailed structure for each test case was already there, so we just had to follow our original plan and that really helped streamline the writing process.
  
  \item What pain points did you experience during this deliverable, and how
    did you resolve them?
    
    One challenge we had was adapting to the requirements from our supervisor, which led to the adjustments in the test cases throughout development. We resolved this by maintaining flexibility in our code approach and updating our test plans to adjust for those implementation changes. Overall, there weren't too many issues that were a pain to deal with.
     
  \item Which parts of this document stemmed from speaking to your client(s) or
  a proxy (e.g. your peers)? Which ones were not, and why?
  
  As mentioned before, the changes to test cases came directly from adapting to the requirements from our supervisor over the course of many meetings. One good example is FR-6 in our original VnV Plan, which was the player's ability to request to join a team. Our supervisor thought it would be annoying for captains to see many team invites, as players could just constantly request to join all the teams. Therefore, he asked us to remove the functionality completely to only allow captains to invite players they wanted. Some other parts of the documents were changed purely by our own thoughts and opinions, such as removing the need for captains to input game results (Win/Lose/Tie) in FR-8. We decided that it was a good change to improve the user experience, and speed up the process for captains to submit scores.
  
  \item In what ways was the Verification and Validation (VnV) Plan different
  from the activities that were actually conducted for VnV?  If there were
  differences, what changes required the modification in the plan?  Why did
  these changes occur?  Would you be able to anticipate these changes in future
  projects?  If there weren't any differences, how was your team able to clearly
  predict a feasible amount of effort and the right tasks needed to build the
  evidence that demonstrates the required quality?  (It is expected that most
  teams will have had to deviate from their original VnV Plan.)
  
  We have already discussed the modifications in the plan in the previous questions above, so we won't bother discussing it again in this section. Our VnV Plan originally had automated testing, but we had to deviate from that due to the superiority of manual testing for this website. It was extremely easy to test features, such as adding players to a team and verifying by looking at the database manually. 
  
  We've set the basis up of automated testing using Jest and connected CI to it, but it is not entirely complete at this deliverable checkpoint. Further, the unit testing plan was slightly different from the actual activities conducted for VnV. We've removed a few unit tests that were decided to be better tested manually or in system tests, and added some unit tests that we deemed necessary for the foundation of our application.

  The rest of our VnV Plan did not have to change, so there weren't many differences. Our team was able to clearly predict the right tasks to build the evidence that demonstrated the required quality because we have tremendous experience with sports platforms, participating in sports all our lives. Ever since coming to McMaster, we have regularly used McMaster IMLeagues to play intramurals, and we understand what makes a sports platform perform well from the users perspective. We also have experience with full-stack web development from our previous co-ops and internships, and we are familiar with building a big project from scratch. Testing was often regularly done before pushing our products to production.
